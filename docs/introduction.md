This site allows you to try a number of different outlier or anomaly detection algorithms.  The code for this app is [available on github](https://github.com/rajshah4/outliers_shiny).

To use this page, choose your model, sample, and number of clusters.  Outliers are marked with a star and cluster centers with an X.

When changing samples it is necessary to press the Update Sample Button.  You may add or remove points by using the mouse button.  It is also possible to highlight a region and remove all the points.  This app is running on a server with very little memory, so be gentle.  Some of the fuzzy clustering algorithms may take a while. 

For more information on how to use this app, the models, the samples, and how to find outliers and anomalies, take a look at the tutorial section.
